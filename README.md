    password; 'Password12!'
  - Signup to your own account [here](http://localhost:3000/users/sign_up).

### DevOps
- Cronjobs, via Whenever gem, are used to run cleanup tasks.
  - On deployment need to run `bundle exec whenever --update-crontab`

### Docker
- dev.Dockerfile & prod.Dockerfile files are written for respective environments.
- To build development or production images adjust docker-compose.yml web and
  sidekiq services to build from appropriate prod. or dev. Dockerfile. (Should adjust to be able
  to pass in environment argument.)
- For running on 1) localhost or 2) separate service redis_url must be set to:
  - config/cable.yml - 1) 'redis://localhost:6379/1' 2) 'redis://redis:6379/1'
  - config/initializers/sidekiq.rb - 1) 'redis://localhost:6379/0' 2) 'redis://redis:6379/0'
  - apply correct host value in; BroadcastMessageJob
  - set instance ip address as default_url_options in production.rb
  - comment out `require('daisyui')` from tailwind.config.js
  - comment out application.html.erb daisyui CDN link for loval development.
- must define RAILS_MASER_KEY when docker compose up'ing the containers, i.e.:
  `RAILS_MASTER_KEY=my_prod_key_value docker compose up`.

### AWS S3
- Uses `'fakebook-s3-<%= Rails.env %>' buckets for both development and production, under user 'fakebook' (AWS access keys in credentials) with the 'fakebook-s3-policy' permissions.

- Optimise for N+1 in views other than post#index (partially done)
- Build in omniauth Githuib Signin (not done)
- Jest test ConversationChannel JS
- Set RSpec up with Guard
- Deploy App

### Future ToDos:
